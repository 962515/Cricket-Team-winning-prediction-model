# Cricket-Team-winning-prediction-model
# Overview
This project aims to predict the winner of a cricket match based on various factors such as team composition, historical performance, venue, weather conditions, and more. The model uses machine learning algorithms to analyze past match data and generate predictions for future games.
# Features
Data Collection: Gather data from reliable cricket databases and sources.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for model training.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features that influence the outcome of a cricket match.
Model Training: Train various machine learning models and select the best performing one.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the winner of upcoming matches.
Visualization: Visualize the results and important features using graphs and charts.
